long_description: 'Part of the W4M project: http://workflow4metabolomics.org CAMERA:
  http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CAMERA.html This function check
  annotations of ion species with the help of a sample from opposite ion mode. As
  first step it searches for pseudospectra from the positive and the negative sample
  within a retention time window. For every result the m/z differences between both
  samples are matched against specific rules, which are combinations from pos. and
  neg. ion species. As example M+H and M-H with a m/z difference of 2.014552. If two
  ions matches such a difference, the ion annotations are changed (previous annotation
  is wrong), confirmed or added. Returns the peaklist from one ion mode with recalculated
  annotations. BEWARE: this tool don''t come with its script. You will need to install
  the dedicated package_camara_w4m_script too'
